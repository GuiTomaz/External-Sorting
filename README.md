# External-Sorting
This program read and sort a binary file using external sorting. 

The external sorting works reading the binary file that will be sorted, splits the file into classified(sorted) partitions and merge these partitions writing a new file,
the output file. 
If you have the file "numberslist", then the programm will generate "numberslist_MERGE" after processing.

*Still needs updating to process .dat files.
